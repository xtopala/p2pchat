# p2pchat
Making a simple terminal based chat app wiht libp2p.
This chat should allow users to jump between different chat rooms. Also, users are allowed to change their usernames at any point they choose to do so.

Would love to try out and implement:

- [ ] AutoRelay
- [ ] Support for QUIC transport

- [ ] Password protected Chat Rooms  
- [ ] Support other PubSub routers (FloodSub, RandomSub, EpiSub)
